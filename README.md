Final website creation
PURE HEAVEN — Final Project Website
====================================

Contents of the ZIP (ready to submit):
- index.html            (Homepage / Landing)
- page2.html            (About Us)
- css/style.css         (Main stylesheet)
- assets/logo.png       (Vintage PURE HEAVEN logo)
- assets/favicon.ico    (Favicon for browser tabs)
- assets/coffee-hero.png
- assets/coffee-thumb.png

How to preview locally
----------------------
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Navigation links connect to `page2.html` and the Contact anchor.

How to replace images / logo
----------------------------
- Place your exported images into the `assets/` folder. Keep names or update the <img> paths in the HTML files.
- Recommended export formats: WebP or compressed PNG/JPG. Keep hero images around 1200px wide for balance.
- To change the favicon, replace `assets/favicon.ico` (64x64 or 32x32 icon).

Fonts
-----
- The project uses system serif fonts for a vintage look. To match your Figma fonts:
  1. Add a <link> to Google Fonts in the <head> of each HTML file.
  2. Update `font-family` in `css/style.css` accordingly.

Customization tips
------------------
- Colors: variables are at the top of `css/style.css` (look for :root). Change --accent, --bg, --cream etc.
- Responsive nav: uses a CSS-only checkbox hack. If you prefer JavaScript-driven menus, replace the header code and add scripts.
- To add more pages: duplicate `page2.html`, update navigation links, and include the same header/footer structure.

Submission
----------
- Zip the whole folder as: FinalProject_FullName.zip (replace FullName with your name)
- Ensure `index.html`, `css/`, and `assets/` are at the root of the zip.

If you want me to:
- Replace placeholders with your actual exported images (you can upload them here), or
- Adjust colors/spacing to match your Figma more exactly, or
- Convert fonts and refine typography,

tell me which one and I’ll update the ZIP right away.
